  # Dispatch cluster TLS configuration (mTLS)
  # The dispatch endpoint is used for internal cluster communication between SpiceDB nodes
  # This configures mutual TLS (mTLS) where both client and server verify each other
  # mTLS is strongly recommended for dispatch to prevent unauthorized nodes from joining
  dispatch:
    # Name of the Kubernetes secret containing TLS certificates for dispatch

    #   - ca.crt: CA certificate to verify other SpiceDB instances
    #
    # Important: All SpiceDB instances in the cluster must share the same CA
    # Each instance should have its own certificate signed by that CA

    # Example using cert-manager with a shared CA:

  # Datastore TLS configuration
  # Configures TLS for connections to the database backend
  # Note: Connection URI and SSL parameters in config.datastore take precedence
  # This section provides an alternative way to configure datastore TLS via secrets
  datastore:

    #   - ca.crt: CA certificate to verify the database server
    #   - tls.crt: Client certificate (optional, for mTLS)
    #   - tls.key: Client private key (optional, for mTLS)
    #
    # This is useful when the database requires client certificate authentication
    # or when you want to manage certificates separately from the datastore URI
    #
    # For PostgreSQL, set config.datastore.sslMode to "verify-ca" or "verify-full"
    # For CockroachDB, set config.datastore.sslMode to "verify-full"
