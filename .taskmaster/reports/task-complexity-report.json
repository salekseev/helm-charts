			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Complete multi-host and multi-path support with configurable path types (Prefix, Exact, ImplementationSpecific) building on existing Ingress template, 2) Add TLS configuration for Ingress with certificate references and support for multiple hosts, 3) Implement NetworkPolicy egress rules for DNS resolution, datastore connectivity, and Kubernetes API access extending existing template, 4) Create controller-specific examples (nginx, Contour) and integration tests with Kind cluster validating Ingress routing and NetworkPolicy enforcement",
			"reasoning": "Two subtasks already completed (Ingress template and NetworkPolicy ingress rules). Remaining work includes multi-host/path support, TLS configuration, egress rules, and integration testing. Complexity reduced from 6 to 5 due to progress. Integration test infrastructure exists from Task 1. Template patterns established. Remaining work straightforward following existing patterns."

			"taskTitle": "Finalize Documentation, Examples, and Release Preparation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Create comprehensive README.md with overview, features, quick start, installation guide, and configuration reference covering all values.yaml fields from completed tasks, 2) Create QUICKSTART.md, PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md with PostgreSQL/CockroachDB deployment steps, TROUBLESHOOTING.md and UPGRADE_GUIDE.md, 3) Create SECURITY.md documenting TLS, NetworkPolicy, RBAC features and compliance best practices, 4) Validate all example files (dev-memory.yaml, production-postgres.yaml, production-cockroachdb.yaml, production-ha.yaml, ingress examples) with helm template, 5) Update Chart.yaml metadata (version 1.0.0, maintainers, keywords, artifacthub annotations), create CHANGELOG.md and LICENSE, create .helmignore, 6) Run final validation suite: helm lint, helm unittest for coverage verification, conftest policy checks, helm package, and complete release readiness checklist",
			"reasoning": "Documentation task complexity is moderate (4/10) as chart implementation is complete and examples exist. Main effort is writing comprehensive documentation covering all features from Tasks 1-9, validating examples, and release preparation. No complex technical implementation required. Templates, tests, and examples are functional. Work is time-consuming but straightforward. Most validation tooling already in CI pipeline from Task 1."
